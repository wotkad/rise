# ü•• Rise - A flexible template for developing websites and applications.

**Rise** is a fast, easy-to-use and customizable template with which you can implement a project of any complexity, from a landing page to a highly loaded service.

The template greatly simplifies such things as building a project, finding the necessary libraries to start a project, generating a sitemap, developing a project architecture, and also offers storing pages in the `.md` format.

**Pattern Includes:**
- Templates in `.pug` and `.scss`
- Connections of `css` and `js` libraries
- Post structure generation
- Scripts for tests
- Scripts for routing
- Scripts to check internal link links
- and much more ...

To get started, you need to install [main dependencies](#-main-dependencies).

## ‚ú® Installation and launch

#### üîó Install dependencies

- **Webpack** and **Webpack Dev Server**:
   - You need to install `Webpack and Webpack Dev Server` with `yarn global add webpack webpack-dev-server`.
- **Yarn**
   - To install, you need to run the `brew install yarn` command in the console or follow the special guide for the OS [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/).

#### üë®‚Äçüíª Development process

1. You need to clone the project with the command `git clone https://git@github.com:wotkad/rise.git` to the directory with projects and change its name to the current one.
2. Open the `project name` directory in the code editor.
3. Install all dependencies with the `yarn install` command.
4. You can start the development process in the project with the `yarn dev` command. (to run the project on your local network, you should run `yarn dev-network` instead, and using the IP address of the host machine (you need to specify it in the `package.json` file for the `dev-network` command), you can get access to the project on other devices).
5. Check the availability of the pages.
6. Make any necessary modifications.

#### üìÑ Adding pages

7. To add a page, you need to create it in the `/views` directory in the required place, after that you need to press `CTRL + C` to stop the development process and run the `yarn dev` command to restart it.
8. To create any section, for example, `/products/product`, where `/products` is a section, in the `webpack.config.js` file, in the `plugins` object, add the line `...utils.pages (MODE, "products")`.

#### üì¶ Build project

9. To start building the project, you must press `CTRL + C` to stop the development server and run the `yarn build` command - the assembly will be created in the `/dist` directory.

#### üî¨ Testing

10. Testing is possible through `http-server` by installing it with the command `yarn global add http-server`. By running `npx http-server -p 9090 ./dist`, you can see the assembly in action at the URL `http://localhost:9090`.
11. Broken Link Checker - Script to check the functionality of links on the entire site (execute the `node blc` command when the project is running).
