#### üîó Install dependencies

- **Yarn**
  - First you need to run the command `brew install yarn` in the console or follow the special guide for the OS [https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/ docs/install/).
- **Webpack** and **Webpack Dev Server**:
  - Then you need to install `Webpack and Webpack Dev Server` using `yarn global add webpack webpack-dev-server` command.

#### üë®‚Äçüíª Development process

1. You need to clone the project with the command `git clone https://git@github.com:wotkad/rise.git` to the directory with projects and change its name to the current one.
2. Open the `project name` directory in the code editor.
3. Install all dependencies with the `yarn install` command.
4. You can start the development process in the project with the `yarn dev` command. (to run the project on your local network, you should run `yarn dev-network` instead of `yarn dev`, and using the IP address of the host computer (it must be specified in the `package.json` file for the `dev-network` command ) you can access the project on other devices).
5. Check page availability.
6. Make any necessary modifications.

#### üìÑ Adding pages

7. To add a page, you need to create it in the `/views` directory in the right place, after that you need to restart the project by pressing `CTRL + C` to stop the development process and run the `yarn dev` command to restart it.
8. To create any section, for example, `/products/product`, where `/products` is the parent section, in the `webpack.config.js` file, in the `plugins` object, add the line `...utils. pages(MODE, "products")`.

#### üì¶ Build project

9. To start building the project, you must press `CTRL + C` to stop the development process and run the `yarn build` command - the project will be created in the `/dist` directory.

#### üî¨ Testing

10. Testing is possible via `http-server`. Before starting, you need to build the project with the `yarn build` command. Next, by running `npx http-server -p 9090 ./dist`, you can see the build in action at the URL `http://localhost:9090`.
11. Broken Link Checker - Script for checking the functionality of links on the entire site (To run, you need to run the `node blc` command when the project is running).
